# GoogleAntiGrief
A craftbukkit plugin that does an automatic background check on new players by using google.

The plugin uses Jsoup and google to do a background check on new players. This can be usefull if they're already banned from other servers or if other players have filed reports against them.

If you want to build the .jar yourself you'll have to add the Jsoup .jar as a library in your IDE.
